 <p> Montreal City Hall is a five storied flashy building exclusively constructed to 
 house the municipal administration. Built in the second empire style, it is one of the 
 most impressive and spectacular buildings in old Montreal. It was constructed between 1872 and 1878 as per 
 the designs suggested by architects Alexander Cowper Hutchison and Henri-Maurice Perrault.This building 
 survived a major fire break in 1922 after which architect Louis Parant completely remodeled the same with more robust construction.</p>
 <p>For over a century and a half, Montreal was the industrial and financial centre of Canada.[98] This legacy has left a variety of buildings including factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries, that today provide an invaluable insight into the city's history, especially in the downtown area and the Old Port area. There are 50 National Historic Sites of Canada, more than any other city.</p>
<br /><p>In 2006 Montreal was named a UNESCO City of Design, only one of three design capitals of the world (the others being Berlin and Buenos Aires).This distinguished title recognizes Montreal's design community. Since 2005 the city has been home for the International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda);the International Design Alliance (IDA).</p>
